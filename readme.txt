* Allows to select an image as a placeholder, to replace the real images during pre-loading. It's recommended to select the lighter images possible to increase the WordPress performance, the image selected will be used in place of images that are not loaded in the first viewport.


**What is Lazy Loading?**

Lazy Loading means that images outside of viewport (visible part of webpage) will not be loaded before user scrolls to them, this action improve the download speed of webpages and reduce the bandwidth consumption. With lazy loading the WordPress performance is increased substantially. 

Normally we only see a part of a webpage we are visiting. To see the rest we usually have to scroll down. For example, in pages with a lot of content in the middle, we can’t see the footer without scrolling down. If Lazy Loading is enabled, only the images in areas that are actually viewed by the user are loaded, and the render time of completed page is reduced. The images in all other areas are loaded only when the user attempts to actually view them by scrolling down to them. This technique increases the loading speed and reduces the bandwidth consumption, as it only loads the images in areas actually "consumed" by the user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How the lazy loading increase the WordPress performance? =

A: The lazy loading doesn't load the website images until images be in the viewport. If the user never scrolls the webpage, some images won't download with a reduction in the bandwidth consumption.

= Q: Why the ring that represent the loading percent of page, in the ring version of loading screen, doesn't display in old browsers? =

A: The ring is drawn with SVG. The standard SVG  is supported only by the new browsers.
