== Description ==

**Loading Page** plugin performs a **pre-loading of images** on your website and displays a **loading progress screen** with percentage of completion. Once everything is loaded, the screen disappears.

**Features:**

* Displays a screen showing loading percentage of a given webpage.
* Allows to choose a loading progress screen. 
* Allows to select the colors of the loading progress screen.
* Allows to display or remove the text showing the loading percentage.
* Lazy Loading feature allows to load faster and reduce the bandwidth consumption. (Pro version only)
* Allows to select an image as a placeholder, to replace the real images during pre-loading. (Pro version only)

**What is Lazy Loading?**

Lazy Loading means that images outside of viewport (visible part of webpage) will not be loaded before user scrolls to them, this action improve the download speed of webpages and reduce the bandwidth consumption.

Normally we only see a part of a webpage we are visiting. To see the rest we usually have to scroll down. For example, in pages with a lot of content in the middle, we can’t see the footer without scrolling down. If Lazy Loading is enabled, only the areas that are actually viewed by the user are loaded. All other areas are loaded only when the user attempts to actually view them by scrolling down to them. This technique increases the loading speed and reduces the bandwidth consumption, as it only loads the areas actually "consumed" by the user.
